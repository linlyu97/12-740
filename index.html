<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ul>
  <li> This project is designed to produce an integrated indoor air quality real-time monitoring system prototype. The system will utilize a multi sensor system that placed at different locations within a relatively closed environment and measure relevant quantities such that could provide insights to the environment air conditions. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<ul>
  Having a good air-quality real time control is extremely important for everyone of us, we sometimes struggle with all different types of sensors we have to buy and install for our house. Lacking an integrated sensing system in the marketplace seems obvious to us,  and our project is designed to resolve this issue that helps residents to dynamically monitor the indoor air condition.
</ul>

  <li>What are you going to achieve by the end of the project specifically?</li>
