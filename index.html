<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ul>
This project is designed to produce an integrated indoor air quality real-time monitoring system prototype. The system will utilize a multi sensor system that placed at different locations within a relatively closed environment and measure relevant quantities such that could provide insights to the environment air conditions. 
</ul>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<ul>
  Having a good air-quality real time control is extremely important for everyone of us, we sometimes struggle with all different types of sensors we have to buy and install for our house. Lacking an integrated sensing system in the marketplace seems obvious to us,  and our project is designed to resolve this issue that helps residents to dynamically monitor the indoor air condition.
</ul>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<ul>
  The proposed outcome of the project will be real-time data collecting system and an alter system dynamically suggest the user to take proper action when any one of the measurements go beyond the theoretical healthy standard.
  The vision of the project is to lay a foundation for IOT system that user can change the indoor conditions using smart devices. (subject to change based on schedule)
</ul>

<ul>
  Currently, we have completed the setup of the sensing system for both temperature, humidity, and smoke measurements. The details of the setup is shown in figure 1. In addition, we have prepared created a closed cubic environment (chipboard box) with two  5cm  x 5 cm window with flexibility to open or close, which served as two windows and also served as input channel of our variables( hot wind from hair blower and humidity from humidifier)

  <img src="/pics/setup1.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Initial setup for the smoke and humidity sensor">

  In terms of data collecting, we have collected the source code from various websites and merged/modified some of them to output the desired data format we are looking for. The 10 minutes time window was used first time as testing and the result data range falls into the expectations.

  The things we have learned so far outside of the class involves how to setup experiment environment, learn the process of how to test our hypothesis using statistical tests. We also learned how to setup the specific sensors configurations and how to potentially collecting different data at the same time.

</ul>

<h3 id="problems-encountered">Problems Encountered</h3>
<ul>
  The problems we have encountered can be categorized into two sections: implementation point of view and project design point of view.

  <li> Implementation point of view</li>, 
  Our design utilized a smoke sensor, specifically the MQ-2, that is used to detect for combustible gas and smoke. The source of generating of combustible or smoke is our biggest concern so far because it both hard to find source and exists potential safety issues. For the temperature and humidity variables, we have come up ways to input the changes into our environment but haven’t implement as such, however, we do expect some difficulties that come up during the process.

  <li> project design point of view </li>
  The issue related to this topic is from a high level point of view. We are not sure if the scope of our project is within the course expectations.  Since we measurements don’t related to any frequency domain measurements, which we have covered in the class, we do have this concern and we may, adjust our project after talking to TAs and professor.

</ul>

<h3 id="future-plan">Future Plan</h3>
<ul>
  In the next two weeks, we are planning first to make the experiment conditions better such as using type to protect the paper box because our project involves with humidity and changing such variables may cause damage to the environment.  Further, we will embed sensors in the system and changing the variables to see how our data changes corresponding to the variable changes. We also plan to talk to the professor to see if he has any suggestions for the project.
